## Main Packages

- **react**, **react-dom**: UI library
- **react-router-dom**: Routing for React
- **typescript**: Type safety
- **vite**: Fast build tool
- **tailwindcss**, **@tailwindcss/vite**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **i18next**, **react-i18next**: Internationalization
- **eslint**, **prettier**: Linting & formatting

## Deployment

To deploy the site to GitHub Pages:

1. Make sure your repository is set up with the correct `homepage` in `package.json` (if needed).
2. Run:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```
   This will build the project and publish the `dist` folder to the `gh-pages` branch using the `gh-pages` package.

The `predeploy` script ensures the site is built before deploying.

## ESLint & Formatting

ESLint is configured for React, TypeScript, and hooks best practices. Prettier is used for code formatting. See `eslint.config.js` for details.

## Git Hooks: Husky & lint-staged

[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) is used to manage Git hooks, and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) ensures that only staged files are linted and formatted before each commit.

- **Pre-commit hook**: Automatically runs `npm run lint` and `npm run format` on staged files matching `*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,css,md,json}` before allowing a commit.
- Configuration for lint-staged is in `.lintstagedrc.json`.
- You can find the Husky hook in `.husky/pre-commit`.

This helps maintain code quality and consistent formatting across all commits.

## Theming

Theme context is provided via `ThemeProvider` (`src/theme.tsx`). Use the theme toggle button in the header to switch between dark and light modes.

## Internationalization

Translations are managed in `src/locales/en/translation.json` and `src/locales/tr/translation.json`. The language can be switched via the header dropdown.

## Experience & Projects

Professional experience and projects are listed in the UI and translation files. Project images are loaded from external sources or the `public` folder.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
